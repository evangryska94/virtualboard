Design Implementation details
 - Board has a finite area which players can clearly see
	 - Players can move camera to view corner and part of the abyss beyond
	 - Board itself can be textured with multiple layers (grass on bottom, wood on top)
 - Camera can be panned and rotated freely
 - Expandable menu from the side of the screen
	 - Appears when the mouse is very close to the edge of the canvas
 - Depth is handled by z axis ordering
	 - When an object is moved to be overlapping another, the z ordering of many objects may be affected
 - Click and drag misses result in camera movement
 - Objects should be able to be rotated
