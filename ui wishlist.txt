UI WISHLIST  

(Legends: x - completed, v - completed in an alternative way, o - pending/commented)

process of joining a lobby
 v - Add a name field to joining/hosting if they do not select one
 x - any modal redirects should not make the user re-click the button they were trying to access
 x - prompt for color with username instead of with lobby
 x - hide password field for servers that do not have one

Pre-game
==========
 x - add refresh button to top of page
   - add like a "developed by x, y, z, using etc" at the bottom of the lobby page to make it look less empty
 x - text inputs on modals should grab keyboard focus
 x - anything clickable should change the mouse cursor into a clicking hand cursor, especially lobby entries and colors
 x - hitting the escape key should close a modal
   - Oh yeah that's right, we need an actual home page separate from the lobby list as our index page with information
 o - resume should only appear if the old lobby exists (comment: we need a polling function that tests if a lobby with given id exists)
   - clicking on the message "No games found, but you can create a lobby!" should bring up the modal to create a lobby

In-Game/General
==========
 x - when getting multiple errors from the server, they should all stack in some kind of scrollable display - this includes errors received while an old error is still up
 x - we need typing in the chat to not register key events in the game
 o - sending a chat message maybe should cause the text box to lose focus, but maybe not idk (comment: I will go for the way it is now)
   - chat box view needs to go top to bottom and not be a fixed size
 o - hit enter to bring chat box into focus
   - static objects should not change the mouse pointer to appear clickable
 x - page reload on dead socket should be able to be cancelled
   - things need to not trigger on mouse move while a piece is being dragged
   - right click context menus, since we need shift+click for selecting multiple items probably
   - some sort of drag threshold for when the user may be trying to shift+click or draw
   - Indicator for decks vs single cards
   - context menus should not go off edge of screen
   - right now it seems the camera is limited in movement but pieces are not
   - sub menu for custom content
   - chat and usernames have script injection vulnerabilities
   - sidebars should not interfere with the canvas when not being used
   - the chat box should scale with its contents
   - apparently control+c, control+a, and the like are disabled for some reason

Feature Ideas
==========
   - Readable and editable notepads/counters
   - actaully implementing scribbles for real this time
   - piece momentum when thrown, shake dice to roll
 x - hitting tab or something to bring up the current player list
   - saving/loading
