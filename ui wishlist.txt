UI WISHLIST
process of joining a lobby
 - Add a name field to joining/hosting if they do not select one
 - any modal redirects should not make the user re-click the button they were trying to access
 - prompt for color with username instead of with lobby
 - hide password field for servers that do not have one

Pre-game
==========
add refresh button to top of page
add like a "developed by x, y, z, using etc" at the bottom of the lobby page to make it look less empty
text inputs on modals should grab keyboard focus
anything clickable should change the mouse cursor into a clicking hand cursor, especially lobby entries and colors
hitting the escape key should close a modal
Oh yeah that's right, we need an actual home page separate from the lobby list as our index page with information

In-Game/General
==========
when getting multiple errors from the server, they should all stack in some kind of scrollable display
 - this includes errors received while an old error is still up
we need typing in the chat to not register key events in the game
sending a chat message maybe should cause the text box to lose focus, but maybe not idk
chat box view needs to go top to bottom and not be a fixed size
hit enter to bring chat box into focus
static objects should not change the mouse pointer to appear clickable
page reload on dead socket should be able to be cancelled
things need to not trigger on mouse move while a piece is being dragged
right click context menus, since we need shift+click for selecting multiple items probably
some sort of drag threshold for when the user may be trying to shift+click or draw
Indicator for decks vs single cards

Feature Ideas
==========
Readable and editable notepads/counters
actaully implementing scribbles for real this time
piece momentum when thrown, shake dice to roll
hitting tab or something to bring up the current player list
saving/loading
