How to run the selenium tests
1. pip install selenium
2. ** For Mac **
	Using chromedriver_mac in this directory doesn't seem to work. Install it with homebrew instead.
		brew install chromedriver
3. Run the following depending on your OS:
	mac:
		java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=chromedriver_mac -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.48.2.jar
	linux:
		java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=chromedriver_linux -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.48.2.jar
	windows:
		go to step 3
4. python test_interface.py
5. Check to make sure that the selenium server closed (will only close automatically for windows)
